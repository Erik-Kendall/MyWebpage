        <h2>Gaming & Tabletop</h2>
        <p>I have a deep passion for gaming, both digital and tabletop. From immersive video games to strategic board games, I enjoy the challenge and creativity they offer. I'm an avid player of Dungeons & Dragons (DnD) and Rogue Trader, where I can dive into rich storytelling and complex character development. Additionally, I love playing card games like Coup, which test my strategic thinking and social skills. Gaming is not just a hobby for me; it's a way to connect with others and explore new worlds.</p>

        <p>Technology has always fascinated me, and I'm particularly drawn to web development and artificial intelligence. My career goal is to become a skilled web developer, creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites that make a difference.

        <h2>Creative Passions</h2>
        <p>Writing is one of my greatest creative outlets. I enjoy crafting stories, whether they're short fiction, character backstories for tabletop games, or personal reflections. Writing allows me to express my thoughts and ideas in a way that feels both therapeutic and fulfilling. I often find inspiration in the world around me, and I love the process of turning those ideas into written words. For me, writing is not just a hobby; it's a way to explore new perspectives and share my creativity with others.</p>

        <h2>Community & Learning</h2>
        <p>I believe in the importance of giving back to the community and fostering a love for learning. I have experience in tutoring, where I help others understand complex subjects and develop their skills. It's incredibly rewarding to see someone grow and succeed with a little guidance. I'm also interested in volunteering with organizations like Habitat for Humanity, where I can contribute to building stronger communities. Both tutoring and volunteering are ways for me to make a positive impact and connect with others who share a passion for learning and helping.</p>

        <h2>Favorite Media</h2>
        <p>I have a deep appreciation for media that inspires and entertains. Some of my all-time favorites include the "Back to the Future" trilogy, which combines science fiction, humor, and heartwarming storytelling. I'm also a fan of the "Drizzt" series by R.A. Salvatore, which offers epic fantasy adventures and complex characters. Additionally, I enjoy the nostalgic charm of "ReBoot," a groundbreaking animated series that explored the world of computers long before it was mainstream. </p>
