                        <p>From the mind of Brennan Lee Mulligan and featured on Dimension 20, <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> is a TTRPG inspired by <em>Kids on Bikes</em>, designed to emulate the over-the-top action of 80s and 90s action movies. This rules-light system focuses on collaborative storytelling, where players take on the roles of unlikely action heroes. A key mechanic involves 'blowing up' your stats to increase their dice size, leading to increasingly ridiculous and powerful abilities. Expect a fast-paced, comedic, and explosive experience where players might even get to take over the GM seat for short bursts of time.</p>
